Situated at around 3400 feet above sea level, Illickal Kallu is a major tourist attraction in Moonnilavu and Thalanadu village of Meenachil taluk. Only one half of the original rock remains, as the other half of the rock has fallen off. The nearest town is Teekoy. Numerous mountain streams originate from this peak and flow down to form the Meenachil River. Tourists must trek 1 km to reach the summit of the peak. Illikkal Mala comprises three hills, each rising up to 3,400 ft above sea level. Each of the hills has a peculiar shape. One of them resembles a mushroom, which is why it is known as Kuda Kallu. The second hill has a small hunch on the sides and is therefore referred to as Koonu Kallu. There is a ?¹/2-foot-wide bridge called Narakapalam connecting these two hills. The beauty and the landscape of illikkal kallu is similar to that of the pillar rocks in Kodaikanal. It is said that the mythical medicinal herb Neela Koduveli grows here.

        Mango Meadows is the world’s 1st Agricultural theme park spread across 30 acres of land with more than 4500 species of plants and trees. It is one of the most bio diverse pieces of land on the planet. In addition to this the park houses 50 cottages of which 12 have been fully completed. The cottages and accommodations erected within the park are carefully placed without disturbing the soft fabric of the environment. For anyone who seeks peace and wishes to flex his mind and soul, Mangomeadows will never be a disappointment. Project Mango Meadows was the brainchild of Mr. N K Kurian. With the rise of technology and an increasingly disconnected life of people around the world, Kurian was well aware of the unconscious longing that people had in their hearts for Mother Nature. He, just like everybody else knew that tradition and images from his childhood memories were quickly turning into stories and myths.
